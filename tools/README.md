Checks that keep the skills honest. All are plain Python 3 with no
dependencies; `check-cli.py` and `check-symbols.py` use the plugin's own
`bin/rbt` / `bin/uv`, so they test against exactly the Reboot version
the plugin pins.

| Tool | What it measures | Fails when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `budget.py` | Words an agent reads before writing code, per front door | `--ceiling N` is exceeded |
| `check-cli.py` | Every `rbt …` command and `.rbtrc` line vs `rbt --help` | a flag or subcommand is unknown |
| `check-symbols.py` | Every `reboot…` import / dotted name / stdlib call vs the pinned package | a symbol doesn't resolve |
| `findings.py` | Schema + summary of `findings/` | an item breaks the schema, or a `resolved_by` section doesn't exist |

Baseline numbers: `findings/BASELINE.md`.
